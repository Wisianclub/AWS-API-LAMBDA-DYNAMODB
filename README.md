AWS Serverless Multi-Tier Architectures with Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda

The multi-tier application (three-tier, n-tier, and so forth.) has been a cornerstone architecture pattern for decades, and remains a popular pattern for user-facing applications. Although the language used to describe a multi-tier architecture varies, a multi-tier application generally consists of the following components:

Presentation tier: Component that the user directly interacts with (for example, webpages and mobile app UIs).

Logic tier: Code required to translate user actions to application functionality (for example, CRUD database operations and data processing).

Data tier: Storage media (for example, databases, object stores, caches and file systems) that hold the data relevant to the application.

The multi-tier architecture pattern provides a general framework to ensure decoupled and independently scalable application components can be separately developed, managed, and maintained (often by distinct teams).

This PROJECT focuses on a specific implementation pattern for this architecture using Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda.
